# Steamworks.js

A modern implementation of the Steamworks SDK for HTML/JS based applications.

## Why

I used [greenworks](https://github.com/greenheartgames/greenworks) for a long time and it's great, but I gave up for the following reasons.

* It's not being maintained anymore.
* It's not up to date.
* It's not context-aware.
* You have to build the binaries by yourself.
* Don't have typescript definitions.
* The API it's not trustful.
* The API implement callbacks instead of return flags or promises.
* I hate C++.

## API

```js
const steamworks = require('steamworks.js')

// You can pass an appId, or don't pass anything and use a steam_appid.txt file
const client = steamworks.init(480)

// Print Steam username
console.log(client.localplayer.getName())

// Tries to activate an achievement
if (client.achievement.activate('ACHIEVEMENT')) {
    // ...
}
```

You can refer to the [declarations file](https://github.com/ceifa/steamworks.js/blob/main/client.d.ts) to check the API support and get more detailed documentation of each function.

## Electron instructions

Steamworks.js it's a native module and cannot be used by default in the renderer process. To enable the usage of native modules on the renderer process, the following configurations should be made on `main.js`:

```js
const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
    // ...
    webPreferences: {
        // ...
        contextIsolation: false,
        nodeIntegration: true
    }
})
```

You also have to enable some flags on chromium to make the steam overlay work. Put this code on the final of `main.js`:

```js
app.commandLine.appendSwitch('in-process-gpu')
app.commandLine.appendSwitch('disable-direct-composition')
```

## How to build

Make sure you have the latest [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [Clang](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/requirements.html). We also need [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) installed and running.

Install dependencies with `npm install` and then run `npm run build:debug` to build the library.
