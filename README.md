# Steamworks.js

A modern implementation of the Steamworks SDK for HTML/JS and NodeJS based applications.

## Why

I used [greenworks](https://github.com/greenheartgames/greenworks) for a long time and it's great, but I gave up for the following reasons.

* It's not being maintained anymore.
* It's not up to date.
* It's not context-aware.
* You have to build the binaries by yourself.
* Don't have typescript definitions.
* The API it's not trustful.
* The API implement callbacks instead of return flags or promises.
* I hate C++.

## API

```js
const steamworks = require('steamworks.js')

// You can pass an appId, or don't pass anything and use a steam_appid.txt file
const client = steamworks.init(480)

// Print Steam username
console.log(client.localplayer.getName())

// Tries to activate an achievement
if (client.achievement.activate('ACHIEVEMENT')) {
    // ...
}
```

You can refer to the [declarations file](https://github.com/ceifa/steamworks.js/blob/main/client.d.ts) to check the API support and get more detailed documentation of each function.

## Installation

To use steamworks.js you don't have to build anything, just install it from npm:

```sh
$: npm i steamworks.js
```

### Electron

Steamworks.js is a native module and cannot be used by default in the renderer process. To enable the usage of native modules on the renderer process, the following configurations should be made on `main.js`:

```js
const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
    // ...
    webPreferences: {
        // ...
        contextIsolation: false,
        nodeIntegration: true
    }
})
```

To make the steam overlay working, call the `electronEnableSteamOverlay` on the end of your `main.js` file:

```js
require('steamworks.js').electronEnableSteamOverlay()
```

[Some users have reported an issue when launching Linux apps](https://github.com/ceifa/steamworks.js/issues/42). A workaround is available, to pass a `--no-sandbox` as an argument to the app launcher in Steamworks --> Steamworks Settings --> Installation --> General Installation --> Launch Options. (Note that `--no-sandbox` makes it unsafe to run third-party code, but as long as you're only running game code under your own control, it should be fine.) A screenshot example of this appears below.

## How to build

> You **only** need to build if you are going to change something on steamworks.js code, if you are looking to just consume the library or use it in your game, refer to the [installation section](#installation).

Make sure you have the latest [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [Clang](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/requirements.html). We also need [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) installed and running.

Install dependencies with `npm install` and then run `npm run build:debug` to build the library.

There is no way to build for all targets easily. The good news is that you don't need to. You can develop and test on your current target, and open a PR. When the code is merged to main, a github action will build for all targets and publish a new version.
